# Singleton

Singleton is a creational design pattern that allows you to ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing
a global access point for that instance.

### In Kotlin
To use the Singleton partner in Kotlin just define the class as "object",
that way it will have no constructors and all of its methods and attributes will be static.
