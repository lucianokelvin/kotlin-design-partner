# Abstract Factory

The Abstract Factory is a creational pattern that allows creating object families always based on their abstract classes
and not their concrete classes.

In our example we have a GUI that changes the instances of the Button or Window depending on the OS used. The algorithm
used to draw the elements will always be the same, but the objects that will be used will depend on the factory used.
